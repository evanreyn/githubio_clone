<b>1. Detecting small changes in atmospheric CO2.</b>
<br /><br />
CO2 is a greenhouse gas present in the atmosphere in trace levels. Its concentration has increased from about 280 ppm (parts per million) in the pre-industrial era to 400 ppm today. Can we actually visualize and detect such small changes?
<br /><br />
Materials (per student): 2-liter clear plastic soda bottles (2), water, vegetable dye, syringe or eye dropper
<br /><br />
Procedure: Have each student put 1 liter of water in each of their bottles. Drop 0.28 cc of dye into one, 0.40 cc of dye into the other.  Teacher then collects all bottles, marking the inside of the 0.4 cc bottle caps with a colored pen. All bottles are placed on a table and scrambled. The class is asked to separate them into two groups, pre-industrial and today. The class then examines the bottle caps and calculates their experimental error.

<b>2. A scale model for tropical cyclones.</b>
<br /><br />
A tropical cyclone is a strong circular atmospheric vortices powered by its core of warm moist air. Earth's rotation organizes the cyclone into its circular shape. 
<br /><br />
Materials: turntable, pie plate, water, vegetable dye, antacid tablets (optional)
<br /><br />
Procedure: Mix a small amount of dye in a small glass of hot water. Center the pie plate on the turntable. Partially fill the pie plate with cold water, then rotate at a steady rate until the cold water is spinning with the plate. Pour the warm dyed water into the center of the spinning cold water and observe the resulting flow. Repeat this experiment with the following changes (a) reverse the rotation direction (if possible), (b) fill the plate with warm water and use cold dyed water, Â© drop in a few antacid tablets in addition to the warm dyed water and (d) try different rotation rates, including no rotation and reverse rotation. What are the differences, and which case produces a structure most like a tropical cyclone?

<b>3. A tornado vortex in a bottle.</b>
<br /><br />
Tornadoes are very intense vortices that sometimes develop from supercell thunderstorms. This experiment demonstrates one mechanism by which tornado vortices are intensified. 
<br /><br />
Materials (per student): double threaded coupling, 2 clear 2-liter soda bottles, water.
<br /><br />
Procedure: Fill one bottle with tap water (add a bit of dye if you wish), attach the couple and the second empty bottle. Invert the 2-bottle rig and measure its draining time. Next, tilt the rig slightly and rotate slowly, simulating a weak supercell, and measure the drain rate. Then rotate rapidly, simulating a strong supercell, and repeat the draining until a strong vortex is formed. Does rotation increase or decrease the draining rate? Now reverse the direction of rotation and observe the tornado. According to these experiments, is there a preferred rotation direction for tornados? Finally, roll the rig across a table or across the floor then quickly tilt into the upright position. Can you care ate a tornado vortex this way? How does this experiment possibly relate to the mechanism of tornado formation in nature?
<br /><br /><br />
<b>4. Tsunami in a bottle.</b>
<br /><br />
Tsunamis are long wavelength ocean waves generated by undersea earthquakes. This experiment visualizes the tsunami shape and illustrates wave amplification in coastal regions and associated hazards.
<br /><br />
Materials (per student)  clear 2-liter soda bottle with cap, water, vegetable dye (optional), plastic beads (optional).
<br /><br />
Procedure: Pour 1/2 liter of water (lightly dyed if you wish) into the bottle and cap tightly. Holding it horizontal, rock the bottle with a tilting motion, adjusting the rocking frequency until a large wave develops. This is the resonant condition. Determine the propagation speed of the wave by measuring the rocking frequency with a watch. The propagation speed is approximately the rocking frequency (cycles per second) multiplied by twice the length of the bottle. Repeat this experiment using 1 liter of water. How does the propagation speed depend on the water depth (i.e., increase or decrease, and in what proportion)? Placing one hand at each end of the bottle, detect the force at each end as the wave arrives. On which end is the force greater, and why? Which end represents the coastal region, and which end represents the open ocean? Finally, add some plastic beads to the bottle and repeat the experiment. Does the propagation speed of the wave change? Do the end forces increase? If so, explain. What does this imply about the hazards from floating debris in tsunamis?

<b>1. Seismic Waves on a Slinky</b>
<br /><br />
a. Hold a slinky in the vertical position about chest high, so that its free end just touches the floor. Compress then release the top few turns, observing the compression wave as it propagates down the slinky. What is the relationship between the wave direction and the direction that segments of the slinky are vibrating? This is a model of a seismic primary or compressional wave.
<br /><br />
b. Holding the slinky in the same position, shake its top end suddenly, releasing a bending wave. Observe its propagation down the slinky. What is the relationship between the wave direction and the direction that the segments of the slinky are vibrating? This is a model of a seismic secondary wave.
<br /><br />
c. Stretch the slinky across the table or bench. Shake one end in the horizontal direction, releasing a bending wave in which the slinky segments vibrate horizontally. This is a model of a seismic surface wave.
<br /><br /><br />
<b>2. Desktop Earthquake Cycle</b>
<br /><br />
The  purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate elastic rebound and the earthquake cycle.
<br /><br />
Materials: brick, sandpaper sheet, string, duct tape, spring or rubber band. 
<br /><br />
Procedure: Tape the string to the top of the brick along its centerline, forming a loop at one end. Attach the spring or rubber band to the loop. Place the brick on the sandpaper. Slowly stretch the spring until the brick slips. Measure the slip distance. The product of the elastic force in the stretched spring times the slip distance is called the seismic moment of the "earthquake". The difference in the force on the spring just before the slip event and just after the slip event divided by the area of the brick (the fault area) is called the stress drop of the event. Are all earthquakes generated by this rig equal in moment and stress drop? How does the nature of the fault surface (sandpaper) affect the earthquake? Can you produce steady sliding, rather than stick-slip behavior with this device?
<br /><br /><br />
<b>3. Desktop Seismometers</b>
<br /><br />
1. Download application for your smartphone or laptop: <a class="people" href="http://seismac.en.softonic.com/mac">http://seismac.en.softonic.com/mac</a>
<br /><br />
2. Start application and place phone or laptop on tabletop
<br /><br />
3. Hit tabletop with rubber mallet. Which components record the wave?
<br /><br />
4. Hit the various sides of the table with the same mallet. Now which components record the wave?
<br /><br />
5. Set the threshold alarm on the application at its first level. Distribute several smart phones with increasing distance from the hammer strike. By increasing the force of the hammer strike, trip the phone alarms at successive distances. Does this behavior indicate 
that the magnitude scale needs a correction factor for epicentral distance?
<br /><br /><br />
<b>4. Cola Volcano Eruption</b>
<br /><br />
Materials:  Diet cola (8 or 12 oz bottles), tray, salt, optional sand or clay volcano material
<br /><br />
Note: this experiment does not need the sand/clay volcano, but it adds to the interest. Just mold the sand/clay around the cola bottle to achieve the desired volcano shape.
<br /><br />
Procedure: 1. Place the unopened soda bottle in the tray and (optional) surround it with the sand/clay mold. <br /><br />
2. Remove the soda cap.<br /><br />
3. Quickly pour in several tbls of salt, through a funnel or folded paper.<br /><br />
4. Observe the eruption. <br /><br />
What causes this eruption to occur? What portion of the soda evacuates the bottle? Repeat the experiment, adding different amounts of salt and using sodas at different temperatures. Also, try inserting a paper plug into the bottle neck following the salt.
