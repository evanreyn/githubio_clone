<h2>Outreach Activities</h2>
<h4>Ingenuity Project Mentoring in Earth Science</h4>
<p>The Ingenuity Project at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute is a four-year high school program for talented and motivated students who excel in mathematics and science.  In conjunction with fast-paced, content-rich mathematics and science classes taught by experienced teachers, research is emphasized within the daily classes and by offering opportunities to work off-campus.<br /><br />
During the Research Practicum phase of the Ingenuity Program, qualified high school students work with mentors, who are professionals engaged in science or engineering research to develop independent research projects.  Students contribute to the body of research and, in some cases, have their work acknowledged in peer-reviewed journals.  As seniors, they are required to submit the results of their work to competitions, including the Siemens Competition and the Intel Science Talent Search.<br /><br />
The proximity of Poly to the JHU Homewood campus (1.5 km via Baltimore Metro bus service) allows for year-round participation of Ingenuity students in Open Earth System research projects. Intern opportunities center on computationally-oriented activities using MATLAB as a training platform. Starting with routine data analysis and graphics programming, Ingenuity students may progress to advanced data analysis and code development, depending on skill levels. Each student will be assigned a mentor from the PI team. In conjunction with the mentoring PI, research projects will be defined along with a project schedule that includes a project report intended to lead to a peer-reviewed co-authored publication. Participants will be awarded Summer support stipends, and will participate in regularly-scheduled workshops in Olin Hall on the JHU campus.</p>
<h4>Teacher Professional Development in Earth Science</h4>
<p>The second component of our outreach consists of a partnership with the Maryland Earth and Space Science (ESS) Certification Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Education, and involves Summertime coursework for educators. We propose to develop a Summer course designed for middle school and high school teachers from Baltimore City and surrounding counties to serve as ESS training for area teachers. The Maryland State requirement for teacher professional development includes two university-level courses taken in every five year period. As a component of Open Earth Systems project, we will develop and offer some week-long intensive Summer course offerings entitled "Natural Catastrophes" and "The Earth System" intended to satisfy the Maryland State requirements with participating teachers receiving a stipend conditional to successful course completion. Our objective is to provide these teachers the background and resources they would need to educate students in Earth Science concepts and current issues.</p>
